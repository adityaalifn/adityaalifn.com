        <p className="text-lg">
          Hello! I'm Aditya Alif Nugraha, a Senior Software Engineer with over 5 years of experience in developing innovative and scalable solutions. My passion lies in creating efficient, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Throughout my career, I've worked with a diverse range of technologies, specializing in full-stack development with a focus on React, Node.js, and cloud technologies. I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new technologies, believing that continuous learning is key to staying ahead in the fast-paced world of software development.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of community and knowledge sharing, which is why I actively participate in tech meetups and occasionally write technical blog posts.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project, discuss the latest tech trends, or just have a friendly chat about coding and life!
